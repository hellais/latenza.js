# Why?

Latenza.js based websites are basically a series of JSON objects that contain
markdown.
This is because HTML has outgrown its original goals and has become to contain
much more than merely markup. For this reason with Latenza.js we plan to bring
back this separation between the content served by the server and the code
being executed on the machine.

### On web app to rule them all
For every latenza based website there is only one web application, this means
that the web app served from www.example.com (or statically loaded in the
users browser) can be used to access the content stored on foobar.com.
