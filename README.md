# Why?

Latenza.js based websites are basically a series of JSON objects that contain
markdown.
This is because HTML has outgrown its original goals and has become to contain
much more than merely markup. For this reason with Latenza.js we plan to bring
back this separation between the content served by the server and the code
being executed on the machine.

# To have fun!

To start playing around with it just run 

    ./start.sh

Then open a browser and point it to `127.0.0.1:8000` to see what is going on.
